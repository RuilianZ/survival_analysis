# Survival Analysis

1.	Determine the survival and density functions for a continuous survival time variablewith hazard function
Hint: consider the derivative of log(1 + x2).  

2.	For the following data
1,2,2,4+,5+,6,7+,8+,9+,10+,
where + denotes a right censored observation. Write out the data table and calculate the following by hand.  
(a) Find the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function;  
(b) Find the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard function; (c) Find the Fleming-Harrington estimate of the survival function.  

3.	Use the tongue data in the R package KMsurv. For each tumor type (aneuploidyand diploid), plot the Kaplan-Meier curve of survival function and its pointwise 95% confidence intervals (using the log transformation). What are the estimated 1-year survival rate and 95% CI?
